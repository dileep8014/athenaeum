### Key Concepts
> Atomic design allows us to see our UIs broken down to their atomic elements, and also allows us to simultaneously step through how those elements join together to form our final UIs. We learned about the tight bond between content and design, and how atomic design allows us to craft design systems that are tailored to the content that lives inside them.

### Atomic Design Units
*(smallest to largest)*  
* **Atoms**  (the smallest atomic unit for components)  
* Molecules
* Organisms
* Templates
* **Pages** (composed from other components)
