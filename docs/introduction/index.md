# React Component Library (RCL)

[Source Code](https://github.com/policygenius/athenaeum)

React Component Library is a tool to help create and maintain robust design systems, allowing a developer to roll out higher quality, more consistent User Interfaces (UI) faster.
RCL is a style guide for React components. It lists component `propTypes` and shows live, editable examples. You can use it to generate a static HTML page to share and publish or as a workbench for developing new components.

### Why is this useful?
* Provides a common library to compose new User Interface flows.
* Prevents 'reinventing of the wheel' syndrome.
* Avoids CSS entanglement.
* Because it's awesome.
