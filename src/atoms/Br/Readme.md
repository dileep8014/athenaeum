## What is the `<Br />` tag?
`<Br />` is a `<span />` that acts like a line-break to allow line-breaking based on media query sizes.

Example:
`<Br small large ... />`

### Br Example:
```example
  <div>
    <h2>
      I can decide where <Br small large />things will line break based on media queries. (small & large)
    </h2>

    <h3>
      I break on <Br small /> small.
    </h3>
  </div>
```
